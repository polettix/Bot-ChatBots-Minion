=head1 NAME

Bot::ChatBots::Minion - Minion-based pipeline breaker for Bot::ChatBots

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Bot::ChatBots::Minion version {{[ version ]}}.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   # We assume that you want to break a long pipeline into two parts
   # where the second has to be executed inside a Minion

   # First pipeline's program has something like this:
   use Minion;
   use Bot::ChatBots::Minion;
   my $minion = Minion->new(...);
   my $cbm = Bot::ChatBots::Minion->new(minion => $minion);

   # Now you can use $cbm->enqueuer as a final tube e.g. as the processor
   # for Bot::ChatBots::Telegram::LongPoll/WebHook
   use Bot::ChatBots::Telegram::LongPoll;
   Bot::ChatBots::Telegram::LongPoll->new(
      token => $ENV{TOKEN},
      processor => $cbm->enqueuer
   );

   # Second pipeline's program is probably similar to this:
   use Mojolicious::Lite;
   plugin Minion => (...); # same configs as the other program!!!
   plugin 'Bot::ChatBots::Minion' => (
      dequeuer => $second_pipeline_part
   );
   app->start; # start program with "appname minion worker"


   ######################################################################
   # If you just have a Mojolicious::Lite app with e.g. Telegram WebHooks
   # it's even simpler
   use Mojolicious::Lite;
   plugin Minion => (...);
   plugin 'Bot::ChatBots::Minion' => (dequeuer => $second_pipeline);
   plugin 'Bot::ChatBots::Telegram::WebHook' => (
      ...
      processor => app->chatbots->minion->enqueuer,
   );
   ...
   app->start;
   # now you will have to both start the Mojolicious::Lite app and the
   # Minion worker!
